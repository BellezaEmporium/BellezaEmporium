### You found me, congratulations !

Greetings young padawan. 
I'm an diplomed engineer specialised in IT, and I develop on many different languages, aiming to discover and improve myself (such as PHP with Symfony or Laravel, C#, Python and JavaScript...).

You might know me from the [query-streamlink](https://github.com/LaneSh4d0w/query-streamlink) project, that permitted to open new doors for making live streams available for everyone, or for being one of the many translators of PCSX2, for the French language.

- üå± I'm currently looking for a job.
- üì´ I've worked in the fields of Web development and on Artificial Intelligence (see my repos and commits).
- üòÑ Pronouns: he/him.
- ‚ö° I've already worked or have knowledge with :
  - these programming languages : C, C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, a little bit of Go 
  - these runtime environments : Node.js, Java Environment (JDK/JRE)
  - these frameworks : front & back = PHP -> Symfony, Laravel | frontend only = JS -> a little bit of React and Vue
