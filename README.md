### You found me, congratulations !

Greetings young padawan. I'm a polyvalent developer, aiming to discover and improve myself on many programmation languages (such as PHP with Symfony or Laravel, and also C#).

You might know me from the [query-streamlink](https://github.com/LaneSh4d0w/query-streamlink) project, that permitted to open new doors for making live streams available for everyone.
Or you might know me for being one of the many translators of PCSX2, in the French language.

- 🔭 I’m currently working with a MERN Stack (Mongo Express React Node).
- 🌱 I’m currently creating a fully functional website in collaboration with teammates.
- 📫 You can find me here or on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/theofficialomega), but if there's something you want to ask, just send an email [here](mailto:lanesh4d0w@gmail.com). (Do not send emails requesting stuff, when you can request them using the various repositories in which I operate, as they will be ignored. Do not also send me emails containing no subject / nothing in it nor weird stuff).
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm stubborn (whoops !).
- I have already worked with the C, C++, C#, Python, JavaScript, SQL, Oracle, HTML, CSS, PHP (with Symfony, looking after Laravel) languages and looking forward to learn more. I have a little bit of knowledge of Go (if you're interested about this language and want to see some interesting implementations, go follow my engineering comrade [Karitham](https://github.com/Karitham) for some interesting Go projects).
- I speak French (native), English (915 TOEIC European test) and a bit of Spanish (but bear with me while I'll try to sort out a sentence lol).
