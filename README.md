### You found me, congratulations !

Greetings young padawan. 
I'm a polyvalent developer, aiming to discover and improve myself on many programmation languages (such as PHP with Symfony or Laravel, and also C#).

You might know me from the [query-streamlink](https://github.com/LaneSh4d0w/query-streamlink) project, that permitted to open new doors for making live streams available for everyone, or for being one of the many translators of PCSX2, for the French language.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently finishing my IT engineering studies.
- ðŸŒ± I'm on a work/study course in an multinational company.
- ðŸ“« I've worked in the fields of Web development and on Artificial Intelligence (see my repos and commits).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm stubborn (whoops !).
- I have already worked with :
  - these languages : C, C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, a little bit of Go *(if you're interested about this language and want to see some interesting implementations, go follow my engineering colleague [Karitham](https://github.com/Karitham) for some interesting Go projects)*
  - these frameworks : front & back = PHP -> Symfony, Laravel | frontend only = JS -> a little bit of React and Vue
  - these backend libraries : JS -> Node.js + Express.js / ORMs like Eloquent and Doctrine
  - these SQL engines : mySQL, MongoDB, Oracle DB
  - these IDEs : Visual Studio (both Code and 2017/2019/2022), Eclipse, JetBrains suite (PyCharm, IntelliJ, WebStorm, PHPStorm)
*and I'm looking forward to learn more.*
- I speak French (natively), English (915 TOEIC European test) and a bit of Spanish (pero voy a necesitar tiempo para hacer una frase jaja).
