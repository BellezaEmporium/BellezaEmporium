### You found me, congratulations !

Greetings young padawan. I'm a polyvalent developer, aiming to discover and improve myself on many programmation languages (such as PHP with Symfony or Laravel, and also C#).

You might know me from the [query-streamlink](https://github.com/LaneSh4d0w/query-streamlink) project, that permitted to open new doors for making live streams available for everyone.
Or you might know me for being one of the many translators of PCSX2, in the French language.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently dealing with many projects.
- ðŸŒ± I'm on a work/study course in an international company.
- ðŸ“« You can find me here or on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/theofficialomega), but if there's something you want to ask, just send an email [here](mailto:lanesh4d0w@gmail.com). *(Please refrain from requesting stuff, when you can request them using the various repositories in which I operate, as they will be ignored. Do not also send me emails containing no subject / nothing in it nor weird stuff).*
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm stubborn (whoops !).
- I have already worked with :
  - these languages : C, C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP
  - these frameworks : PHP -> Symfony, Laravel
  - these front-end frameworks : JS -> React, a little bit of Vue
  - these back-end services : JS -> Node.js + Express.js / ORMs like Eloquent and Doctrine
  - these SQL engines : mySQL, MongoDB, Oracle DB
  - these IDEs : Visual Studio (both Code and 2017/2019/2022), Eclipse, JetBrains (PyCharm, IntelliJ, WebStorm, PHPStorm)
and I'm looking forward to learn more. 

I have a little bit of knowledge of the Go programming language. *(if you're interested about this language and want to see some interesting implementations, go follow my engineering comrade [Karitham](https://github.com/Karitham) for some interesting Go projects)*

- I speak French (natively), English (915 TOEIC European test) and a bit of Spanish (pero voy a necesitar tiempo para hacer una frase jaja).
